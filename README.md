## Summary
The purpose of the ‘Things To Do Places To Go’ project is to create a website which will
allow people to find activities to do. From small adventures in the garden, to big
adventures on days out.  Eventually advertisers will be able to use the site to display
their banners.

## Business Goals

- Create an easy to use website which will keep users coming back time-after-time with a growing database of activities.
- Allow users to submit their own activity ideas.
- Allow advertisers to have banners on the website to help generate revenue.

## Customer Goals
- Search for an activity to do.
- Easy to find the information so they can make an informed decision.
- Have the ability to submit an activity idea for the website.
- Be able to keep a list of their favourite activities.

## Advertiser Goals
- (this is part of our future development, as the app gets more popular)
- The ability to have a banner on the website to attract potential customers to
their website.
- Access information about how many clicks my banner has received

## UX

### Ideal Customer:
- English speaking (UK & Ireland based/visiting)
- Looking for an activity for themselves or the family.
- Wanting to share an activity they have seen or done.

### Ideal Advertiser:
- (this is part of our future development, as the app gets more popular)
- English speaking (UK & Ireland based)
- Wants to advertise their service/product on an activity based website.

## User Stories

### Customer Stories
1. How do I search for activities using a word or phrase?
2. How do I find activities by category.
3. How can I submit my own idea for an activity to the database.
4. How can I see all the activities I have submitted.
5. How can I edit an activity I have submitted.
6. How do I find featured activities.
7. How do I find newly added activities.
8. How do I keep a list of my favourite activities.

### Advertiser Stories

2. How do I get my banner on the website?
3. How can I find out how many clicks my banner has received.

## Information Architecture
### Database Choice
For this project I chose to use the NoSQL database, MongoDB.
This choice was based on the ability of each document to only have to store
the fields for data we have, but to have the flexibility to easily add new
fields at any time. ie. Not all activities have Venue data to store.


### Database Schema
The 'Things To Do Places To Go' database has 2 collections: activities and users.

## Surface
After the initial thought of doing an activity website I had a browse on
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/tvc5imO5pXk) and found the image below:
![Things To Do Places To Go - background idea](docs/background.jpg)

The colors for the website were chosen based on this image, keeping with the fresh greens, and using other colours from the image for logo,
buttons, etc

The google fonts chosen were 'Raleway' and 'Oswald' which I think match the website layout.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python v3.8.6
- Flask - micro web framework
- Jinja - template language
- Bootstrap v4.5
- Fontawesome - free icons
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - for website fonts 'Oswald' & 'Raleway'.
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - used to ensure the CSS code was valid for browsers which match (last 2 versions, > 5%)
- [Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/) - used to compress JPEG/PNG content.

## Features
All the site pages have a responsive navigation bar with site logo on left, clicking the logo will take the user to the Home page. The nav-bar is sticky and remains at
the top of all pages, so basic navigation is always at hand.

The activity hero-image is displayed on all pages.

At the bottom of all site pages is the footer which gives the social
media links to get in touch.

## Acknowledgments
The idea for this project came from the fact that we to are always looking for
activity ideas for the family.

A big thank you to my mentor, the Slack community and many great reference sites out there including Stackoverflow and W3Schools, as well as the online documentation for Python, Flask, MongoDB, Amazon S3, Heroku, Bootstrap, etc
